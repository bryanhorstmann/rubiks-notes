# 2-Look OLL Guide
The aim of OLL(Orientation of the Last Layer) is to get all yellow sticker to face up if you are doing white cross.

Normally there are 57 algorithms to do this in one step. Most people, especially beginners, cannot be bothered or cannot learn all of them. So they retreat to 2 look, which means that you do it in two steps. first you make a cross on top, then you do one of the seven remaining algs. Pretty straight forward.

## Case 1: No corner orientated
